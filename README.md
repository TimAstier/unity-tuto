# Dungeon base builder

## TODO

- [x] Move camera with keyboard
- [ ] WASD for english keyboards
- [ ] Pause / Unpause
- [ ] Move character
- [ ] Fog of war
- [ ] Map generation
- [ ] Hover on tiles to get info

## Ideas

- Roguelike / DOTA like hero
- Starts in a base like the movie with a labyrinth
- Goes on expeditions in a randomly generated environment
- Comes back to camp and upgrades
- Camp needs management and is threatened
- Move around and fight Rimworld style.
- Every day the maze is reset.
- Damage system as RimWorld
- Tower-defence style base defense.
- Chess-like pawn moves to example the base limits (need to build new pawns, and can be moved once a day).
- Base building in the maze/dungeon
